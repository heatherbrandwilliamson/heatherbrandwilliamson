### Hi there :smile:

Skills | Current Projects | Education | Experience | Interests | Contact | Portfolio

A full-stack junior developer. My background combines creativity with a super high level of technical knowledge and I love bringing these traits into my coding. I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested and reusable.

Having recently completed the intensive 12 weeks of Makers Academy, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

Previously in my career, I qualified as an Architect. Throughout my studies in architectural design, I developed a deep understanding of the principles of design, user experience, and creative problem-solving. I honed my skills in spatial planning, conceptual development, and technical drawing, which have provided me with a solid foundation in design thinking and attention to detail. 

I thrive under pressure and am comfortable working in unstructured environments. My excellent communication skills, adaptability, and organisational abilities enable me to add value in all situations. 

I am currently looking for a full-stack developer role in London.

## Skills

## Curious
Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. 

## Problem Solver 

## Excellent communicator - Having always worked in a client facing role, since leaving University I am well accustomed to understand clients needs, listening and managing their expectations. 

## Creative - As an architect, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.

## Inquisitive - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.

## Attention to detail - I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details, from my experience deivering high end architectural projects. This skill has been amazing during my learning to code
