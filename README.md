A full-stack junior developer. My background combines creativity with a super high level of technical knowledge and I love bringing these traits into my coding. I have always been passionate about tech. The way it is changing our lives really excites me so I started coding and immediately got a lot of satisfaction from it. Logic, quick feedback, stack trace to find my way to the bug and infinite possibilities of what I could have created for the users with it. 

Having recently completed the intensive 12 weeks of Makers Academy, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

Previously in my career, I qualified as an Architect. Throughout my studies in architectural design, I developed a deep understanding of the principles of design, user experience, and creative problem-solving. I honed my skills in spatial planning, conceptual development, and technical drawing, which have provided me with a solid foundation in design thinking and attention to detail. 

I thrive under pressure and am comfortable working in unstructured environments. My excellent communication skills, adaptability, and organisational abilities enable me to add value in all situations. 

I am currently looking for a full-stack developer role in London.
