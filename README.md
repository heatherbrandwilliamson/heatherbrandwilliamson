### Hi there :smile:

### HEATHER BRAND-WILLIAMSON

I am a designer, maker and coder. What excites me most about working in software development is being able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real problems. 

I am an architect turned software developer;

Throughout my studies in architectural design, I developed a deep understanding of the principles of design, user experience, and creative problem-solving. I honed my skills in spatial planning, conceptual development, and technical drawing, which have provided me with a solid foundation in design thinking and attention to detail.
